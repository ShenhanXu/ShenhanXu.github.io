**Iron Man** is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. 

## Origin
The character made his first appearance in *Tales of Suspense* #39 (cover dated March 1963). A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his own life and escape captivity. Later, Stark augments his suit with weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries.

## Abilities and Equipment
Iron Man possesses a wealth of gadgets and his powered suit of armor, providing superhuman strength, durability, flight, and an array of weapons. The armor is invented and worn by Stark (with occasional short-term exceptions). Other people who have assumed the Iron Man identity include Stark's long-time partner and best friend James Rhodes.

### Armor
Over the years, Stark has created multiple versions of his Iron Man armor, each improving upon the last. The most well-known of these armors include the Model 32 "Iron Man Armor Model 13" (also known as the Modular Armor), the Model 42, and the Extremis Armor.

### AI Systems
Iron Man's armor has been equipped with a number of different AI systems over the years, the most famous of which is J.A.R.V.I.S. J.A.R.V.I.S. has been a key part of many of Iron Man's adventures, providing tactical support, controlling the suit's systems, and even running Stark's house for him.

## Influence and Legacy
Iron Man has been a member of the superhero team the Avengers for most of the character's existence. Beyond comics, the character has been adapted into animated TV shows, video games, and a highly successful live-action film series where he is portrayed by Robert Downey Jr.
